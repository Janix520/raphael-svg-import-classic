RaphaÃ«l SVG Import plugin
=========================

What is this?
-------------

An extension to the Raphael Vector Library. It enables Raphael to import raw
SVG data.

Fork Notes
----------

This is a fork of [raphael.svg-import](https://github.com/wout/raphael-svg-import).
When the original raphael-svg-import reached 0.0.3, a major backwards-incompatible change was introduced.
Instead of parsing SVG documents, it used regular expressions. This was undesirable for several reasons:

* Used regular expressions to parse XML. Rebuilding something that browsers can do natively.
* Loss of document structure. Groups (`<g>`) are lost.
* Additional steps needed to load a svg file.

Usage
-----
See demo.html for the full example. Use AJAX to retrieve your SVG file as an XML document.
Then use importSVG() to convert the SVG into a raphael.js set:

```javascript
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  jQuery.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "assets/demo.svg",
    dataType: "xml",
    success: function(svgXML) {
      var paper = Raphael(10, 10, 800, 600);
      var newSet = paper.importSVG(svgXML);
    }
  });
});
```

If you want the Raphael paper dimensions to automatically match the SVG:

```javascript
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  jQuery.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "assets/demo.svg",
    dataType: "xml",
    success: function(svgXML) {
      var root = svgXML.getElementsByTagName('svg')[0].getAttribute('viewBox').split(' ');
      var width = root[2],
          height = root[3];
      var paper = Raphael(width, height);
      var newSet = paper.importSVG(svgXML);
    }
  });
});
```

If you want to import the SVG from an element within the page you can access to
the element:

```xml
<svg id="mysvg" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" width="500px" height="500px" viewBox="0 0 500 500" enable-background="new 0 0 500 500" xml:space="preserve">
	<circle opacity="0.3" fill="#FF0000" enable-background="new" cx="251.5" cy="255.5" r="179"/>
</svg>
```
And you can access to the svg element by its id:
```javascript
var paper = Raphael(10, 10, 500, 500);
var newSet = paper.importSVG(document.getElementById('mysvg'));
```
In the assets folder a demo.svg file is provided.<br/>
Nothing fancy but it gives you a starting point.


Dependencies
------------
- [Raphael JS](http://raphaeljs.com/)


Tests
-----

### Qunit

Open `tests/qunit.html` in your targeted browers. You'll find a series of
simple SVGs that each test a specific aspect of the conversion. A command line
version can be run with `grunt qunit`. A hosted version can be found
[here][qunit tests].

### Visual

Open `tests/visual_tests.html` in your targeted browsers. A hosted version can
be found [here][visual tests]. The visual tests are deprecated for the qunit
tests.

### Old IE testing

Follow the same instructions as above IE. When looking at the Qunit test in IE,
all tests will fail, but the output should look the same as other browsers.

### From the command line

```bash
$ grunt test
Running "qunit:all" (qunit) task
Testing tests/qunit.html .............OK
>> 20 assertions passed (57ms)

Done, without errors
```

### Writing tests

There's a domain specific language (DSL) to make writing tests easier. In
`tests/qunit.html`, there's a `tables.test` element. Every `tbody` inside is a
test suite, and every `tr` is a test case. The first cell, a `th`, has the name
of the test. The second cell, a `td` has the `svg` that's to be processed. Back
in the first cell, make a `ul.expect > li` with items that have the jQuery
selectors required to assert that the Raphael output is correct.

Final Notes
-----------
I've tried keeping all the files as close to the original as possible.
So there are lots of files not relevant to this fork in the tree.

There is a bug in the minified version of of Raphael.js that most people use.
It's best to just grab the uncompressed source and minify it yourself.
